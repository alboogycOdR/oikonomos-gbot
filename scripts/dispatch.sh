#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dispatch.sh — launch a builder (grok|codex) headlessly against PLAN.md.
# Usage: scripts/dispatch.sh grok [--dry-run]
#
# NOTE (2026-08-02): the Windows mirror scripts/dispatch.ps1 now launches each builder
# in its OWN detached console window by default, because running the builder as a child
# of the dispatching process meant an ORCH harness reaping its background job killed the
# builder with it -- four sessions were lost that way, twice mid-write. This POSIX script
# is deliberately NOT changed to match: it is invoked from a real terminal by a human or
# by the autopilot, neither of which reaps its children mid-run, so blocking in-process is
# correct here and keeps stdout capture simple. If that ever stops being true, the fix is
# setsid/nohup into a per-launch log, mirroring the .ps1's .devteam/launch/ layout.
# Wave I (I1): mode-aware. control.mode=legacy (default) behaves exactly as
# before — builder scans PLAN.md, claims its own task, edits PLAN.md itself.
# control.mode=strict flips to claim-at-dispatch (this script claims/resumes
# the task before launch via scripts/control.py) plus stdout capture and
# devteam-control fence extraction after the session ends. No hybrid: the
# mode gate below is a hard branch, never a partial mix of both behaviors.

fi

if [[ "$CONTROL_MODE" == "strict" ]]; then
  PROMPT="${IDENTITY_OVERRIDE}You are $ID, a builder in a multi-agent dev team. Working directory: $WT (your isolated git worktree; coordination PLAN.md lives at $REPO_ROOT/PLAN.md on main — control.mode=strict: you never write PLAN.md yourself).
Your task is $TASK_ID ($RESUME_OR_CLAIM by the dispatcher before this session started — do not re-claim or re-branch).
Procedure: (1) Read AGENTS.md and $BRIEFING, then PLAN.md, fresh from disk, for $TASK_ID's Spec_References/Owned_Paths/Acceptance_Criteria. Read dossiers/$TASK_ID.md in full if it exists (your prior work log) before acting. (2) If resuming: continue on the existing branch task/$TASK_ID-$SUFFIX at the exact stopping point recorded in the dossier. If newly claimed: create branch task/$TASK_ID-$SUFFIX in your worktree. (3) Implement strictly against Spec_References, touching ONLY files under Owned_Paths plus your own dossier (dossiers/$TASK_ID.md — append a Work Log entry at minimum every ~30 minutes of work and at every stopping point; it is your heartbeat, since you never touch PLAN.md for this). (4) Test everything. (5) Emit a devteam-control block as the LAST thing you print, fenced exactly like this:
\`\`\`devteam-control
{\"control_version\": 1, \"task\": \"$TASK_ID\", \"unit\": \"$ID\", \"status\": \"needs_review\", \"progress_note\": \"...\", \"artifacts\": [\"path/a.dart\"], \"test_evidence\": \"...\", \"blocked_reason\": null, \"next_step\": null}
\`\`\`
status must be exactly one of in_progress (mid-session checkpoint — dossier note + next_step, nothing else changes) / needs_review (requires non-empty test_evidence) / blocked (blocked_reason must start with SPEC_AMBIGUITY, MISSING_DEPENDENCY, OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT, SYNC_MISMATCH, TOOLING_FAILURE, or OTHER:). Never done/pending/claimed — those are the supervisor's alone. Conventional Commits ending [$TASK_ID] for your code commits (never for PLAN.md — you don't touch it). Never write to specs/, docs/, REVIEW.md, scripts/, .claude/, PLAN.md, other dossiers, or main."
else
  PROMPT="${IDENTITY_OVERRIDE}You are $ID, a builder in a multi-agent dev team. Working directory: $WT — your isolated git worktree on your own task branch. ALL CODE changes are made and committed there; never put code on main (merging is ORCH's, after review). PLAN.md is the deliberate exception: it is the shared coordination blackboard living at $REPO_ROOT/PLAN.md on main. READ and EDIT it at that path so you both see and publish current state. To record ANY PLAN.md change (claim, status transition, Progress_Note, needs_review) run: scripts/plan_commit.sh 'chore(plan): <what> [$ID]' - it commits PLAN.md alone directly onto main and cannot carry code. DO NOT run 'git push . HEAD:main': that is the old procedure and a known trap - it works on claim, but by needs_review your HEAD sits on your code commits and that push lands them all on the integration branch unreviewed. A PLAN.md commit left on your task branch is invisible to ORCH and the other builders until merge, which defeats the whole point of a blackboard. Code to your branch; PLAN.md to main; never the reverse.
Procedure: (1) Read AGENTS.md and $BRIEFING, then PLAN.md, fresh from disk. If dossiers/TASK-NNN.md exists for your task, read it in full before acting and append a Work Log entry each session — never ask for re-explanation of anything in the dossier. (2) RESUME CHECK FIRST — scan PLAN.md for any task with Assigned_To: $ID and Status: in_progress or claimed. If found, resume that task immediately: re-read its Owned_Paths files and the last Progress_Note to find the exact stopping point, then continue on the existing branch (do not re-claim or re-branch). Only if NO in_progress/claimed task exists: claim the highest-priority pending task Assigned_To: $ID whose dependencies are done — one atomic edit+commit setting Status: claimed, Branch: task/TASK-NNN-$SUFFIX, Started_At. (3) Create (or switch to) the task branch in your worktree and implement strictly against the task's Spec_References, touching ONLY files under its Owned_Paths. (4) Test everything; append Test_Evidence. (5) Append-only Progress_Notes with UTC timestamps and [$ID] tags — if your context is approaching its limit, write a detailed stopping-point note (what is done, what file, exact next step) and commit before stopping. (6) Finish at needs_review (never done), or blocked with a vocabulary reason. Conventional Commits ending [TASK-NNN]. Never write to specs/, docs/, REVIEW.md, scripts/, .claude/, other task blocks, or main."
