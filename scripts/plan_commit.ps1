.SYNOPSIS
    Record a PLAN.md coordination change. The ONLY supported way for a builder
    to claim, transition status, add a Progress_Note, or hand off needs_review.
.DESCRIPTION
    Windows mirror of scripts/plan_commit.sh. Targets Windows PowerShell 5.1 --
    do NOT add "#requires -Version 7".

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    The previous instruction was, from the builder's worktree:
        git add PLAN.md && git commit -m "..." && git push . HEAD:<base>
    That is correct exactly once -- on claim, before any code is committed -- and
    silently wrong every time after. By `needs_review` the builder's HEAD sits
    on top of its own code commits, so `push . HEAD:<base>` pushes the whole
    chain and lands unreviewed code on the integration branch, bypassing the
    merge gate. Observed three times across two builder CLIs; one builder
    escaped only by inventing a `git commit-tree` workaround. Tooling bug, not
    discipline: the failing command is indistinguishable from the working one.

    WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
    PLAN.md lives in the main checkout, which has the integration branch
    checked out. Commit it there with an explicit pathspec:
        git -C <repo-root> commit -m "<msg>" -- PLAN.md
    No push, no HEAD, no rebase. The pathspec form bypasses the index and
    commits only PLAN.md's working-tree content, so carrying code onto the
    integration branch is impossible by construction, not by instruction.
.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\plan_commit.ps1 "chore(plan): claim TASK-007 [S5]"
