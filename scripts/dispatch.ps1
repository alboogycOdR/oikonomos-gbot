.SYNOPSIS
    Dispatch a builder (grok|codex) headlessly against PLAN.md. Windows mirror of dispatch.sh.
.DESCRIPTION
    Targets Windows PowerShell 5.1 (Windows default). Do NOT add "#requires -Version 7".
    Behaviour is 1:1 with scripts/dispatch.sh: validate plan -> ensure detached worktree ->
    resume-first builder prompt -> launch -> re-validate.

    Wave I (I1): mode-aware. control.mode=legacy (default) behaves exactly as before -
    builder scans PLAN.md, claims its own task, edits PLAN.md itself. control.mode=strict
    flips to claim-at-dispatch (this script claims/resumes via scripts\control.py) plus
    stdout capture and devteam-control fence extraction after the session ends. No hybrid.
.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\dispatch.ps1 -Builder grok
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\dispatch.ps1 -Builder codex -DryRun

You are $Id, a builder in a multi-agent dev team. Working directory: $Wt (your isolated git worktree; coordination PLAN.md lives at $PlanPath on main - control.mode=strict: you never write PLAN.md yourself).
Your task is $TaskId ($ResumeOrClaim by the dispatcher before this session started - do not re-claim or re-branch).
Procedure: (1) Read AGENTS.md and $Briefing, then PLAN.md, fresh from disk, for $TaskId's Spec_References/Owned_Paths/Acceptance_Criteria. Read dossiers/$TaskId.md in full if it exists (your prior work log) before acting. (2) If resuming: continue on the existing branch task/$TaskId-$Suffix at the exact stopping point recorded in the dossier. If newly claimed: create branch task/$TaskId-$Suffix in your worktree. (3) Implement strictly against Spec_References, touching ONLY files under Owned_Paths plus your own dossier (dossiers/$TaskId.md - append a Work Log entry at minimum every ~30 minutes of work and at every stopping point; it is your heartbeat, since you never touch PLAN.md for this). (4) Test everything. (5) Emit a devteam-control block as the LAST thing you print, fenced exactly like this:
${Fence}devteam-control
{"control_version": 1, "task": "$TaskId", "unit": "$Id", "status": "needs_review", "progress_note": "...", "artifacts": ["path/a.dart"], "test_evidence": "...", "blocked_reason": null, "next_step": null}
${Fence}
status must be exactly one of in_progress (mid-session checkpoint - dossier note + next_step, nothing else changes) / needs_review (requires non-empty test_evidence) / blocked (blocked_reason must start with SPEC_AMBIGUITY, MISSING_DEPENDENCY, OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT, SYNC_MISMATCH, TOOLING_FAILURE, or OTHER:). Never done/pending/claimed - those are the supervisor's alone. Conventional Commits ending [$TaskId] for your code commits (never for PLAN.md - you don't touch it). Never write to specs/, docs/, REVIEW.md, scripts/, .claude/, PLAN.md, other dossiers, or main.
"@

You are $Id, a builder in a multi-agent dev team. Working directory: $Wt - your isolated git worktree on your own task branch. ALL CODE changes are made and committed there; never put code on main (merging is ORCHs, after review). PLAN.md is the deliberate exception: it is the shared coordination blackboard living at $PlanPath on main. READ and EDIT it at that path so you both see and publish current state. To record ANY PLAN.md change (claim, status transition, Progress_Note, needs_review) run: scripts/plan_commit.sh 'chore(plan): <what> [$Id]'  (PowerShell: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\plan_commit.ps1 'chore(plan): <what> [$Id]'). That script commits PLAN.md alone, directly onto main, and cannot carry code. DO NOT run 'git push . HEAD:main' - that is the old procedure and it is a trap: it works on claim, but by needs_review your HEAD sits on top of your code commits and that push lands them all on the integration branch unreviewed, bypassing review. A PLAN.md commit left on your task branch is invisible to ORCH and the other builders until merge, which defeats the whole point of a blackboard. Code to your branch; PLAN.md to main; never the reverse.
Procedure: (1) Read AGENTS.md and $Briefing, then PLAN.md, fresh from disk. If dossiers/TASK-NNN.md exists for your task, read it in full before acting and append a Work Log entry each session - never ask for re-explanation of anything in the dossier. (2) RESUME CHECK FIRST - scan PLAN.md for any task with Assigned_To: $Id and Status: in_progress or claimed. If found, resume that task immediately: re-read its Owned_Paths files and the last Progress_Note to find the exact stopping point, then continue on the existing branch (do not re-claim or re-branch). Only if NO in_progress/claimed task exists: claim the highest-priority pending task Assigned_To: $Id whose dependencies are done - one atomic edit+commit setting Status: claimed, Branch: task/TASK-NNN-$Suffix, Started_At. (3) Create (or switch to) the task branch in your worktree and implement strictly against the task's Spec_References, touching ONLY files under its Owned_Paths. (4) Test everything; append Test_Evidence. (5) Append-only Progress_Notes with UTC timestamps and [$Id] tags - if your context is approaching its limit, write a detailed stopping-point note (what is done, what file, exact next step) and commit before stopping. (6) Finish at needs_review (never done), or blocked with a vocabulary reason. Conventional Commits ending [TASK-NNN]. Never write to specs/, docs/, REVIEW.md, scripts/, .claude/, other task blocks, or main.
