#!/usr/bin/env bash
# plan_commit.sh — the ONLY supported way for a builder to record a PLAN.md
# coordination change (claim, status transition, Progress_Note, needs_review).
#
#   scripts/plan_commit.sh "chore(plan): claim TASK-007 [S5]"
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The previous instruction was:
#     git add PLAN.md && git commit -m "..." && git push . HEAD:<base>
# run from the builder's worktree. That is correct exactly once — on claim,
# before any code has been committed — and silently wrong every time after.
# By the time a builder reaches `needs_review` its HEAD sits on top of its own
# code commits, so `push . HEAD:<base>` pushes the entire chain and lands
# unreviewed code directly on the integration branch, bypassing the merge gate.
#
# Observed three times across two different builder CLIs before being fixed;
# one builder escaped only by inventing a `git commit-tree` workaround. It is a
# tooling bug, not a discipline problem: the failing command looks identical to
# the working one.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
# ----------------------
# PLAN.md lives in the main checkout, which has the integration branch checked
# out. So commit it there, with an explicit pathspec:
#     git -C <repo-root> commit -m "<msg>" -- PLAN.md
# No push. No HEAD. No rebase dance. The pathspec form bypasses the index
# entirely, so it commits ONLY PLAN.md's working-tree content and cannot pick
# up code, staged or otherwise. Carrying code onto the integration branch is
# impossible by construction rather than by instruction.
