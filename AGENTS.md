# AGENTS.md — Shared Conventions (v1.0.0)

Read this **first**, every session, fresh from disk. Full rules: `docs/COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md` (authoritative). This is the operational summary that Claude Code, Grok Build, and Codex AI all obey.

## Who you are

Identify yourself as exactly one of: `ORCH` (Claude Code, orchestrator/reviewer), `GB` (Grok Build), `CX` (Codex AI), `S5` (Sonnet 5 — Claude Code again, but dispatched headless as a third builder, never as ORCH). Every PLAN.md write you make carries your ID in `Updated_By` and a UTC ISO-8601 `Updated_At`.

`S5` runs the same underlying CLI as `ORCH` — if you are a headless `claude -p` session launched by `scripts/dispatch.ps1`/`dispatch.sh -Builder claude`, your dispatch prompt and `briefings/S5_BUILD_BRIEFING.md` override this file's ORCH-flavored context: you are `S5`, a builder, with none of ORCH's exclusive powers (no merges, no review verdicts, no PLAN.md frontmatter, no other unit's task blocks).

## The ten commandments

1. **PLAN.md is the blackboard.** All coordination flows through it. Never rely on memory of a previous session — re-read it at session start.
2. **Builders only touch their own task block** in PLAN.md, and only the fields marked builder-mutable (Status per lifecycle, Branch/Started_At once, Progress_Notes/Artifacts/Test_Evidence append-only, acceptance-criteria checkboxes, Blocked_Reason). Never edit frontmatter, other tasks, or another unit's lines. Never delete anything.
3. **Only claim tasks assigned to your ID.** `Assigned_To: TBD` is untouchable. Claim = one atomic edit+commit setting `Status: claimed`, `Branch`, `Started_At`.
4. **Owned_Paths is your exclusive territory.** You may create/modify files only under your claimed task's `Owned_Paths`. Need a file outside it? STOP → `Status: blocked`, `Blocked_Reason: OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT`, note what you need. Never edit shared files "quickly".
5. **Work on your task branch in your worktree** (`task/TASK-NNN-<suffix>`, your suffix per the builders registry — e.g. `-gb`, `-cx`, `-s5`, `-s5b`). Never commit **code** to `main` — merging is ORCH's alone, after review. **PLAN.md is the deliberate exception:** your PLAN.md-only coordination commits (claim, status transitions, Progress_Notes, `needs_review`) must land on `main` immediately — because a claim nobody else can see is not a claim — and the *only* supported way to do that is `scripts/plan_commit.sh "chore(plan): <what> [UNIT]"` (or `plan_commit.ps1`). Never `git push . HEAD:main`: that older instruction is correct only on claim, and by `needs_review` your HEAD sits on top of your code commits, so it pushes them all onto the integration branch unreviewed. Observed three times across two builder CLIs before being fixed. Full procedure in your briefing. Conventional Commits, every message ends with `[TASK-NNN]`.
6. **specs/ is read-only for builders.** Spec unclear? → `blocked`, `Blocked_Reason: SPEC_AMBIGUITY`, with the precise question.
7. **Status lifecycle is law:** `pending → claimed → in_progress → needs_review → done`, with `blocked` reachable from claimed/in_progress. Builders never set `done` — that verdict belongs to ORCH after review.
8. **No `needs_review` without Test_Evidence.** Run the tests, paste command + result summary. Untested work is unfinished work.
9. **Leave no silent state.** Session end = `in_progress` + note, `needs_review` + evidence, or `blocked` + reason. Heartbeat Progress_Note at every milestone.
10. **When in doubt, block — don't improvise.** A blocked task costs minutes; an overwrite or spec drift costs days.

## Progress_Notes format

## Project conventions

- Commit style: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:` ...), scope where useful, `[TASK-NNN]` suffix.
- Code: production-ready — error handling, input validation, logging. No stubs left behind unless the task explicitly scopes them.
- Docs: Markdown. Every non-trivial artifact gets/updates a README section.
- Language/tooling per spec; if unspecified, prefer the dominant language already in `src/`.
